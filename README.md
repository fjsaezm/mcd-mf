Functional Methods in Machine Learning
---

Three assignments and a final presentation have been done:

- **Gaussian Processes** simulation and prediction (Folder [HW_01](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-mf/tree/main/HW_01))
- **Kernel approximation** using **random Nystroem features** (Folder [HW_02](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-mf/tree/main/HW_02))
- **Manifold learning** using *unrolling* techniques. In this case, we use **Difussion Maps**  (Folder [HW_03](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-mf/tree/main/HW_03))

The exams taken during the academic year 2021-2022 by both members of the team (@Ocete and me) can be found in the folder [tests](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-mf/tree/main/tests)

    "We see that the plot is really sparse. This, however, **makes sense** since the tangent function goes to $+ \\infty$ when the argument tends to $\\pi/2$ and goes to $-\\infty$ when the argument tends to $-pi/2$, so we have many points that are outliers. A possible solution could be to clip the values to an interval. "
